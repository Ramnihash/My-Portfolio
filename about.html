                        I'm Ramnihash, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at VIT,
                        originally from Pune, Maharashtra. I am focused on building a strong foundation in
                        core computer science while slowly exploring different areas of technology through
                        hands-on learning and experimentation.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy understanding how ideas turn into working digital solutions and how clarity
                        and structure can improve the overall experience. I am still in the learning phase of
                        my journey and believe growth comes from curiosity, consistency, and learning by working
                        on real projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside academics, I enjoy playing cricket, which helps me stay active and refreshed.
                        It gives me time to reset, stay disciplined, and maintain balance, and these qualities also
                        reflect in how I approach learning, problem solving, and personal growth.
